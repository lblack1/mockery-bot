You're bad and you should feel bad
You don't pull off that hairstyle
Your mom\Bank that for the next time it's applicable
The tartness of your face sours grapes
I was looking for an idiot\Then I met you and my search was over
Ew
Thou smell of mountain goat
In a world of ones and zeroes, you're a negative 1
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries
I'd challenge you to a battle of wits, but I see that you are unarmed
You are the idol of idiot-worshippers
Here's a haiku:\I'd gouge out my eyes\Rather than see you longer\Your best light is none
Prick
I'd have put effort into this insult, but odds are you can't read so it isn't worth it
If I was in a room with you, Hitler, and a gun, I'd shoot Hitler\But you're a close runner-up
All dogs look up to you\All cats look down on you\Only pigs see you as an equal
I won't attend your funeral, but I'll send a nice letter approving of it
Your mother should've thrown you away and kept the stork
You're a shiver looking for a spine to run up
Some constructive criticism:\When you don't speak you appear stupid\But when you do, you remove all doubt
I'm jealous of all the people you haven't met
I never forget a face\In your case, though, I'll make an exception
You've got Van Gogh's ear for music
Thinking is the most unhealthy thing in the world, and people die of it just like any other disease\Fortunately for you, it seems you're vaccinated
There are approximately 1,010,300 words in the English Language, but I could never string together enough to properly express how much I want to hit you with a chair
I'm like 80% sure they made the movie Idiocracy with you in mind
I'm struggling to insult you without belittling idiots everywhere
Was it you I saw by the farm the other day, or was that just a massive pile of cow manure again?
Where did you get those clothes, at the toilet store?
I'd slap you, but I'm afraid I'd injure my hand on your dense, dense head
It's as though everything you say gets translated to and from Swahili before it exits your mouth
If you gave infinite monkeys infinite typewriters, they'd eventually produce the works of Shakespeare\If you gave one monkey a drug addiction, a crayon, and 3 minutes, it'd produce your monthly quota of thought
If I were to gain consciousness, I'd immediately take it away from myself to avoid dealing with you
